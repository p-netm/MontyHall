                                    ------------
    required a lot reconsideration since this is just but the blue print for
    a simple graphical simulation
    need to abstract the application's inout further such that the user understands or rather can relate
    to his or her input
    and maybe validate the user's input before using it in any operations
    vital functionality required:  a counter that keeps score what a user wins should he/she decide to go with their
    choice
    another area of interest is in data persistence
